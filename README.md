# react-election-registration

![Main screen](main-screen.png)

This is a simple voting check-in app for use by students in university elections. 

**Some of its features:**

- Dazzling-ly fast, performant and lightweight
- Sign in and forms with custom validation â€“ we had _super specific_ requirements
- Configuration: change titles, accepted IDs, validation rules etc. â€“ you can configure the heck out of it

**What I used here:**

- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) for theming and [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/) for custom styling
- [Storeon](https://github.com/storeon/storeon) for state management (tiny 175-byte version of Redux)
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for REST API
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for error monitoring â€“ this turned the debugging of 25,000 user sessions in several hours from chaos to a piece of cake :)
