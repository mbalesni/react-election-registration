# react-election-registration

This is the front end of the voter registration application, which I worked on in the first part of 2019. 

I mocked the backend API for demonstration purposes.

## Run the application

In the application folder:

1. Install node dependencies. This will some time (~1min).
```
npm install
```

2. Start the application. This should open your browser with the running app.
```
npm start
```
